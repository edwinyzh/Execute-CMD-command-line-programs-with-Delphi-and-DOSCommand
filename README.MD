**Execute CMD command-line programs with Delphi and DOSCommand.**

**Background**

When requiring a command –line program in your Application, setting up
‘createprocess ‘ and pipes is not that difficult. But it would be important to
multithread your code so that your application is not stalled while your
command-line application is running.

Save yourself the trouble as it is easier to use ‘DosCommand’. Straight out, it
is not a simple to use component as it looks?

Read my blog to otain all the necessary information on how to use this component.
